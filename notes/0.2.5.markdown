- Fixes ref bug with anchor. [#34][34] by [@gsechaud][@gsechaud]
- snippet.base_dir. See below.
- image.base_url. See below.

### snippet.base_dir

In order to specify your snippet source paths off a certain base directory
you can define a `snippet.base_dir` property either in the page's front matter
or globally like this (for example):

```sbt
paradoxProperties in Compile ++= Map(
  "snippet.base_dir" -> s"${(sourceDirectory in Test).value}/scala/org/example"
)
```

You can then refer to this snippet base directory by starting a snippet path with `.../`, e.g.

```
@@snip [Hello.scala](.../Hello.scala) { #hello_example }
```

### image.base_url

When placing images via the standard markdown image syntax you can refer
to a configured base URL by starting the image href with `.../`, e.g. like this:

```
![logo](.../logo.png)
```

The `...` prefix refers to a defined a `image.base_url` property that is
specified either in the page's front matter or globally like this (for example):

```sbt
paradoxProperties in Compile ++= Map("image.base_url" -> ".../assets/images")
```

If the image base URL itself starts with three dots (`...`) then these in turn
refer to the root URL of the site.

**NOTE**: As with the other "Parameterized Links" directives this feature will not
allow GitHub to preview the images correctly on the web interface.
