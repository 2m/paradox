### Fixes and enhancements

- Support referenced source definitions. [#59][59] by [@sirthias]
- Add `@javadoc` parameterized link directive. [#52][52] by [@jonas][@jonas]
- Provide ability to disable prettify code highlighting. [#64][64] by [@jonas][@jonas]
- Consistently render content inside block directives. [#51][51] by [@jonas][@jonas]

### Referenced source definitions

One core markdown feature is support for defining link targets in two
ways: either in parens directly following the link text or through a
reference key following the link text in brackets. The first way was always
supported and this addition allows the second way for Paradox's various
link directives, such as `@ref`, `@extref` and `@scaladoc`.

```markdown
Before continuing please read @ref:[the best practices][best-practices] for
using actors as well as the @scaladoc:[Actor API docs][Actor].

  [Actor]: akka.actor.Actor
  [best-practices]: actor-systems.md#actor-best-practices
```

### Disabling code highlighting

In certain cases, fenced code blocks were eagerly highlighted even when a
specific language was specified. This behaviour can be disabled by explicitly
specifying `text` as the language type. For example:

    ```text
    Content which should not be highlighted.
    ```

    @@snip [example.log](example.log) { #example-log type=text }
