### Fixes and enhancements

### Source origin url on GitHub

`$page.source_url$` contains the plain text of the github source url of the current page. Works only if the associated `github.base_url` is defined. If it doesn't, this field returns a null value; then a condition testing like `$if(page.source_url)$` would be necessary in this case.
Provide a new template "source.st" available in the generic theme which allows to display a simple plain text with the link associated to the current file.
