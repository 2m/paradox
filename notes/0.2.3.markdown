### Fixes and enhacements

- Adds per-page properties front matter.
- Adds parameterized links.
- Disables pegdown HARDWRAPS option by default to ignore newlines. [#32][32] by [@jrudolph][@jrudolph]

### Properties front matter

Paradox 0.2.3 adds properties front matter:

    ---
    out : index.html
    ---

The `out` property allows to rename the target name of the current file.
And the `layout` allows to specify the layout we want to be used for the
particular page.

### Parameterized links

Parameterized link directives help to manage links that references external documentation,
such as API documentation or source code. The directives are configured via base URLs defined in paradoxProperties:

    paradoxProperties in Compile ++= Map(
      "github.base_url" -> "https://github.com/lightbend/paradox/tree/${version.value}",
      "scaladoc.akka.base_url" -> s"http://doc.akka.io/api/${Dependencies.akkaVersion}",
      "extref.rfc.base_url" -> "http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc%s"
    )

After which the directives can be used as follows:

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in @extref[RFC 2119](rfc:2119).

    ...

    Use a @scaladoc[Future](scala.concurrent.Future) to avoid that long
    running operations block the @scaladoc[Actor](akka.actor.Actor).

    ...

    Issue @github[#1](#1) was fixed in commit @github[83986f9](83986f9).

#### @scaladoc directive

Use the @scaladoc directives to link to Scaladoc sites based on the package prefix.
Scaladoc URL mappings can be configured via the properties `scaladoc.<package-prefix>.base_url`
and the default `scaladoc.base_url`. The directive will match the link text with the longest
common package prefix and use the default base URL as a fall-back if nothing else matches.

#### @github directive

Use the @github directive to link to GitHub issues, commits and files.
It supports most of [GitHub's autolinking syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/).

The `github.base_url` property must be configured to use shorthands such as `#1`.

#### @extref directive

Use the @extref directive to link to pages using custom URL templates.
URL templates can be configured via `extref.<scheme>.base_url` and the template may contain
one `%s` which is replaced with the scheme specific part of the link URL.
