### Fixes with compatibility implications

- `paradoxTheme` now defaults to `Some(builtinParadoxTheme("generic"))`. To opt out of a theme you must set `None` explicitly. [#19][19] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Fixes and enhancements

- Allows non-H1 headers. [#18][18] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Fixes NPE when `page.st` is not set. [#19][19] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Leady McBreadcrumbs

If a documentation site is contained within an enclosing website it's very pleasant if the breadcrumbs
allows one to navigate back up.

    lazy val docs = (project infile(".")).
      enablePlugins(ParadoxPlugin)
      settings(
        name := "Breadcrumbs Test",
        paradoxLeadingBreadcrumbs := List("Alphabet" -> "https://abc.xyz/", "Google" -> "https://www.google.com")
      )

### Scalafiddle integration

Adds a variation of `@@snip` feature that works with Scalafiddle:

    @@fiddle [Example.scala](./Example.scala) { #fiddle_code extraParams=theme=light&layout=v75 cssStyle=width:100%; }
