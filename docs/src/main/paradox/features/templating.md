Templating
==========

Paradox uses [StringTemplate][st] for the basic templating.

Here is a list of supported properties that can be used in the string template files:

- `$page.title$` : display the title of the page, which corresponds to the highest level of title on the page. More info about use of titles @ref[here](organizing-pages.md#titles)
- `$page.content$` : display the processed content of your entire markdown source file.
- `$page.base$` : display the relative path to the root folder of the project.
- `$page.home$`, `$page.prev$`, `$page.next$` : gives references to specified "links". `home` corresponds to the root page of the project, `next` is the next page, and `prev` the previous one in the paradox navigation. 
  Each "link" can provide four fields:
  - `href` : displays the relative path.
  - `html` : gives directly the url leading to this link.
  - `title` : displays the title of the link (same process than `$page.title$`)
  	- `active` : determines if the link is currently active or not. Particularly useful if we want to check whether we are on the main page or not: `$if(page.home.active)$`
- `$page.breadcrumbs$` : gives the list of the parent folder of the current page and each parent is displayed as a link.
- `$page.navigation$` : gives the links of all pages in the project (except the main page).
- `$page.subheaders$` : determines if the current page contains subheaders or not, which concretely means that it contains multiple sections depending on the `toc-.
- `$page.toc$` : in relation with `$page.subheaders$`, displays the list of all sections on the page as anchor links.
- `$page.properties$`: displays purely the list of the properties for the current page, which contains the actual properties of the page and the global ones shared to all pages. To add properties at page level and how to use them, look at [this](#delimiters).

## Properties front matter

Paradox allows to specify some properties at page level using `---` delimiters at the top of the page.

### out

The `out` property allows to rename the target name of the current file.

```scala
---
out: newIndex.html
---
/*
 * Content of the page
 */
```

where `newIndex.html` will be the new name of the generated file. Links leading to this page are automatically updated.

### layout

The `layout` property allows to specify the template we want to be used for this particular page. The templates are generated by default in paradox in the `target/paradox/theme` folder, but you can create one in `src/main/paradox/_template` folder as a string template file (.st).

```scala
---
layout: templateName
---
/*
 * Content of the page
 */
```

where `templateName` is the name of a template, more precisely the `templateName.st` file, which could either be a predefined template, or a created one in the `src/main/paradox/_template` folder. The default templates generated by paradox depends on the theme used, see [this](themes.md) for more info about themes.

If you want to set a new default template page, let's say `myDefault.st` for all your pages, you can set it by specifying the layout in `build.sbt`:

```scala
  paradoxProperties += ("layout" -> "myDefault.st")
```

### `$` delimiters

Inside the templates (".st" files), it is possible to specify the properties of the page passed to the template by using `$` delimiters. For the following example file:

```scala
---
foo: bar
test: testValue
---
```

It is possible to use those properties in the template files by writing `$foo$` and `$test$`, which is similar to `$page.properties.("foo")$` and `$page.properties.("test")$` respectively.
